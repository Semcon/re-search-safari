# Re-Search Safari Extension

This is the Safari extension for the [Re-search project](http://semcon.com/re-search).

When doing image search on various search engines we've found that quite many professions will show a stereotypical result regarding the divisions of male and female people present in the images.

With this extension you will be presented with an alternative search that together with the original search presents a more gender balanced view.

We've decided to publish this early because we believe this project can benefit from being available in the public realm and hope that others might be interested in developing this further.
